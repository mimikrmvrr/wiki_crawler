Required software
Apache, MySQL and PHP
The Apache webserver is included in NetWare 6.5 and can be installed at server build, or post installation using either the server java console or the remote installer.
Note: The GD2 (graphics resizing, etc) libraries are provided with NetWare 6.5.4. For all other versions of NetWare, you will need to obtain an updated PHP 5.0.5 with GD2 libraries from here if you wish to use the image thumbnails or resizing features of MediaWiki. In either case, the file sys:\php5\php.ini may need to be modified to load the GD2 modules.
Configuration
Apache
After installing Apache you will need to configure it to be able to run PHP modules. You can do this manually or using ApacheAdmin.
Manual Apache Configuration
To do this manually you will need to edit SYS:\APACHE2\CONF\HTTPD.CONF to include the MOD_PHP.CONF located in the same directory.
eg.

   include SYS:/apache2/conf/mod_php.conf

You can add this line anywhere in HTTPD.CONF but it probably makes more sense to add it where other modules are being loaded. If you don't have mod_php.conf it looks likes this:

   ;Load the mod_php 4 module
   ;LoadModule php4_module modules/mod_php.nlm
   
   ;Load the mod_php 5 module
   LoadModule php5_module modules/mod_php5.nlm
   
   <IfModule sapi_apache2.c>
   ;Add the MIME configuration for PHP
   AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
   </IfModule>

You will also need to modify the DirectoryIndex directive to support PHP index files.
eg.

   DirectoryIndex index.html index.htm index.html.var index.php

The DocumentRoot directory for my installation is:

   DocumentRoot "USER:/Web"

ApacheAdmin Apache Configuration
If you have access to the web-based ApacheAdmin (https://server.domain:2200/apacheadmin), you can make all these changes from there to avoid editing httpd.conf by hand. ApacheAdmin automatically modifies the proper .conf files for you.
In the Modules section, turn on MOD_PHP; in the Content Management/Primary Document Directory section, set your web root; and in the Content management/Document Preferences section, add index.php to the beginning of the line. Save your changes and restart apache.

MySQL
During installation of MySQL you will be asked for a username and password. This is not an eDir\NDS account but the root account for the MySQL database engine. You will need this for the MediaWiki Installation.
PHP
For MediaWiki to install you will need to change the default configuration of PHP. This can be done by modifying the PHP.INI file. Depending on the version of PHP this file is located in either
Version 4 - SYS:\PHP\
Version 5 - SYS:\PHP5\
Settings you will nee to change are as follows:

   ; Safe Mode
   safe_mode = Off

The following settings require the location of your MediaWiki installation. I used USER:\Web

   safe_mode_exec_dir = "USER:/web"
   open_basedir = ".;user:/web"
   upload_tmp_dir = user:/web/tmp

In order to use the built-in email functions of MediaWiki (for resetting passwords, etc) the following needs to be modified:

[mail function]
; For Win32 only.
SMTP = your_smtp_ip_address
smtp_port = 25

; For Win32 only.
sendmail_from = youremail@company.com

Installing MediaWiki
After successfully installing the underlying software, you can install MediaWiki.
Download MediaWiki from sourceforge file list (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34373) or portal page (http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/)
Uncompress the MediaWiki source tree to the destination directory of your Wiki. I used USER:\WEB\w\ under my Apache DocumentRoot.
This is all the set-up that should need to be done - well, almost; the path separators are handled wrong on NetWare, to correct that read this bug report: http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2569 and see also: http://www.gknw.de/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=11
Access http://server.domain/w/ and select the link to install mediawiki
Configure mediawiki as instructed by the page.
In case you have difficulty accessing the database, you might need to do this in mysql: To change the mysql password for the root user, do the following: Information from Novell TID http://support.novell.com/cgi-bin/search/searchtid.cgi?/10093962.htm

   1.  unload mysqld.nlm
   2.  at the console, type: mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --autoclose
   3.  at the server console type mysql
   
   This will bring you to the mysql prompt.  At this prompt type the following:
   
   mysql> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('newpwd') WHERE User='root';
   mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   
   Flush privileges will make the change take effect immediately.
   
   You can, in MySQL Version 3.22 and above, use the SET PASSWORD statement: 
   
   shell> mysql -u root mysql
   mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR root=PASSWORD('new_password');
   
   Another way to set the password is by using the mysqladmin command: 
   
   shell> mysqladmin -u root password new_password
   shell> mysqladmin flush-privileges 

If you get a blank page at this point, and it has not created the "LocalSettings.php" file, please contact someone for assistance (either on one of the IRC channels or mailing lists). Sometimes, just hitting Reload in your browser may solve the problem.
If you get a blank page and it has created the LocalSettings.php file, adding this line at the end of the file may help: $wgParserConf['preprocessorClass'] = 'Preprocessor_Hash';
Move generated USER:\WEB\w\config\LocalSettings.php to USER:\WEB\w\, I.e. move it into its parent directory
Enjoy your MediaWiki under NetWare
