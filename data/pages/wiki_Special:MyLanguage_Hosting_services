Be warned that the Wikimedia Foundation does not guarantee the quality of or endorse any of the services on the list.



If you are looking for hosting for your MediaWiki installation and don't want to maintain your own infrastructure, you might be interested in the wiki farms and hosting services listed below.
In addition, most regular web hosting companies allow for installing MediaWiki without too much trouble, although maintaining and upgrading the code would still in most cases be up to you.
