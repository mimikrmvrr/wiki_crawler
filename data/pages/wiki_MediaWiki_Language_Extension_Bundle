MediaWiki Language Extension Bundleshortcut: MLEB
The MediaWiki language extension bundle provides easy way to bring ultimate language support to your MediaWiki. The bundle is a collection of selected few MediaWiki extensions needed by any wiki which desires to be multilingual.
Introduction



The Universal Language Selector is a must have, because it provides an essential functionality for any user regardless of the number of languages they speak: language selection, font support for displaying scripts badly supported by operating systems and input methods for typing languages that don't use the Latin alphabet. It includes freely-licensed fonts, which cover most of the major languages of America, Europe, Middle East, India and South East Asia.
Maintaining multilingual content in a wiki is a mess without the Translate extension, which is used by Wikimedia, KDE, translatewiki.net and other sites, where hundreds of interface translations are updated every day. With Localisation Update your users will always have the latest translations freshly out of the oven. The Clean Changes extension keeps your recent changes page uncluttered from translation activity and other clutter.
Don't miss the chance to practice your rusty language skills, use the Babel extension to mark the languages you speak and find other speakers of the same language in your wiki. And finally the cldr extension is a database of language and country translations.
MLEB has a monthly release schedule, so that you can easily stay on the cutting edge with the constantly improving language support. The bundle comes with clear installation and upgrade instructions (see below). The bundle is tested against MediaWiki release versions, so you can avoid most of the temporary breaks that would happen if you were using the latest development versions instead.
