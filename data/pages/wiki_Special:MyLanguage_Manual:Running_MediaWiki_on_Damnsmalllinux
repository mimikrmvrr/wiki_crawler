why that
When i started using DSL, i wanted to set up a small server for a website on an old TravelMate 510 Series Notebook. The main problem was to get a wikisoftware installed. Read the following instructions, if you also want to do so
preparing the notebook
Before installing the wiki software, the notebook itself had to be set up. To do this, just follow the instructions here and here.
getting the software
prerequisites
The wiki software i used was MediaWiki
to install this, you also need MySql
for the web interface, you need PHP5 and the apache web server.
to install those software, there's a need to install
gnu c compiler with libraries
libxml2
expat
I did the installation with the following packages (no warranty to get other versions running):
gcc1-with-lib.dsl, version 3.3.4
libxml2-2.6.30.tar.gz
expat-2.0.1.tar.gz
mysql-max-4.1.22-pc-linux-gnu-i686.tar
httpd-2.2.6.tar.gz (apache webserver)
php-5.2.4.tar.gz
mediawiki-1.6.10.tar.gz
(optinal) imagemagick.uci from the MyDsl Extension Tool
installing support software
Get all the software above.
Open the MyDsl Extension browser, navigate through "System" to gcc1-with-libs.dls. Select it, then press download. It will be installed.
extracting the software archives
cd into the directory, where you have all the sowftware packages

 tar xvzf expat-2.0.1.tar.gz
 tar xvzf libxml2-2.6.30.tar.gz
 tar xvzf mysql-max-4.1.22-pc-linux-gnu-i686.tar.gz
 tar xvzf httpd-2.2.6.tar.gz
 tar xvzf php-5.2.4.tar.gz
 tar xvzf mediawiki-1.6.10.tar.gz

install expat

 cd expat-2.0.1
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/expat
 make
 make install
 cd ..

install libxml:

 cd libxml2-2.6.30
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/libxml
 make
 make install
 cd ..

now, you're ready to begin installing the wiki software parts:
install mysql

 mv mysql-max-4.1.22-pc-linux-gnu-i686 /usr/local/mysql
 adduser mysql
 

Now the mysql files are in the right place to do the setup.

 cd /usr/local/mysql
 scripts/mysql_install_db

will set up the database.
Then, you can directly start mysql, because the mentioned version is a ready-to-run package:

 support-files/mysql.server start

Now the sql server should be running. You now have to set up a superuser for the mysql database:

 bin/mysqladmin -u root password <yourpasswordhere>

i also did this with mysql 5.1.30
install the apache web server

 cd /httpd-2.2.6
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache --enable-module=all --enable-so
 make
 make install
 cd ..

this has also been tested with apache 2.2.10
installing php
After that, the PHP binaries can be built:

 cd php-5.2.4
 ./configure \
   --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs \
   --with-config-file-path=/usr/local/apache/conf \
   --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql \
   --with-libxml-dir=/usr/local/libxml \
   --enable-ftp \
   --with-gd \
   --enable-bcmath \
   --disable-debug \
   --enable-track-vars
 make
 sudo make install

also works with php 5.2.7, although track-vars is no longer supported
Now, you've installed alle the prerequisites to install the wiki itself.
installing the wiki

 cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs
 mv /<pathToPackage>/mediawiki-1.6.10 wiki

This will move the files of the wiki to the directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/wiki. Make sure, the wiki is allowd to operate in this directory:

 cd wiki
 chmod a+w config

if the mysql server is running, you may now begin to create the wiki database:

 /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p mysql

This will ask you for the password you entered during mysql installation and start the mysql command line. On the command line, enter:

 create database wikidb;
 grant create, select, insert, update, delete, alter, lock tables on wikidb.* to 'wikiuser'@'localhost' identified by 'yourpasswordhere';
 flush privileges;
 \q

Now start the web server:

 sudo /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl start

Since a port (80) has to be opened, you have to do this as root user (using sudo).
After that, you should be able to install the wiki via the web interface. Therefore, open http://localhost/wiki in your web browser and follow the online guide, which should appear.
Troubleshooting
If you just see a directory listing, this may be caused be apache not looking for index.php. In this case, you have to edit /usr/bin/apache/conf/httpd.conf, search for the line

DirectoryIndex index.html

and alter it to

DirectoryIndex index.php index.html

Afterwards, you have to restart apache using

sudo /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart

In case the index php is opened, but not interpreted (you see it's source in the browser), you'll have to do 2 things: 1st, check if there's a file called php.ini in your /usr/local/apache/conf. If not do

cd /usr/local/apache/conf
cp /<path_to_php_setupfiles>/php.ini-recommended php.ini

2nd, locate the line

DefaultType text/plain

in /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf and add as next line:

AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

Now, restart the webserver using

sudo /usr/local/apache/bin/apachectl restart

and try http;//localhost/wiki again.
additional hints
if you would like to use thumbnail pictures within your wiki, you should download imagemagick.uci via the MyDsl Extension Tool (MyDSL Extensions > UCI > imagemagick.uci), load it via

 mydsl-load /<pathToPackage>/imagemagick.uci

and add the lines

 $wgUseImageResize = true;
 $wgUseImageMagick = true;

to the file /usr/local/apache/htdocs/wiki/LocalSetting.php
