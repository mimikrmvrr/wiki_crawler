System
Slackware Linux full install: [1]
Apache: [2]
MySQL: [3]
MediaWiki: [4]
Cur dump of the database (20031231_cur_table.sql.bz2): [5]

Slackware's full installation includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP, though some administrative work is still needed to get them up and running.
There is a more complete LAMP on Slackware HowTo here
Settings
For this guide, I will make the following assumptions about names, directories, and the like, but you will want to make some of them different:
name - The wiki needs a name; this example is called vicuna.
database - It also needs a database, which will also be called vicuna in this example.
passwords - There are several passwords involved, most importantly the password for the wiki database, and the initial administrator account you'll create when running the configuration page.
directory - The directory where the wiki will be installed. In this example, it's /var/wiki.
Configuration of Apache
At a minimum, the webserver must access your wiki on demand. There are better and more complex ways of setting it up, but this will suffice. In /etc/httpd/httpd.conf, in the section:IfModule mod_alias.c, add the following line:

Alias /wiki/ /var/wiki

Replace /var/wiki with the directory you've chosen.
Apache will not be configured to use PHP by default, so you may need to do the following.
Edit /etc/httpd/httpd.conf by uncommenting the line: #Include /etc/httpd/mod_php.conf
Edit /etc/httpd/httpd.conf by adding: index.php to the line DirectoryIndex index.html
Edit /etc/httpd/mod_php.conf by adding: .phtml to the line <FilesMatch \.(php|phtml)$>
Make sure Apache is set to run at startup: chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd
Test your httpd.conf syntax: apachectl -t
Restart/Start Apache: /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd restart.
Configuration of MySQL
Perform the following commands as root.
Copy one of the MySQL configuration files in /etc to my.cnf:cp /etc/my-medium.cnf /etc/my.cnf
Initialize the MySQL databases (only necessary once per system, but harmless):su mysql -c mysql_install_db
Set the Mysql server to start at boot:chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld
Set ownership of the files in /var/lib/mysql/:chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
Start the MySQL daemon:/etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld start
Secure your Installation with the script provided:mysql_secure_installation
You'll be prompted for a root mysql password. (This and all other mysql user passwords are completely independent from the system passwords so don't confuse them!)
Follow the prompts and choose the most secure options that suit your situation.
Configuration of MediaWiki
Go to the directory where you will install Mediawiki, such as /var, and unpack the package:cd /vartar xzvf ~/mediawiki-1.x.x.tar.gz
Rename the directory to something manageable:mv mediawiki-1.x.x wiki
Make the config directory world-writable:chmod o+w wiki/config
Load the configurating page in your web browser and use it. Go to http://my.host/wiki/config/.
Once the configuration has completed successfully, shut off the config directory:chmod 700 wiki/config
And get your LocalSettings.php file installed:mv wiki/config/LocalSettings.php wiki
Edit LocalSettings.php as desired.
Loading the dump
Unzip the dump by typing: bunzip2 20031231_cur_table.sql.bz2 (this will take a while depending on the size of the dump and the speed of your workstation).
Import the dump in your database by starting a mysql session as above, if you have not done so, loading the wiki database (the name as you gave above), by typing: use <wiki db> and then importing the data by typing: source /path/20031231_cur_table.sql. This will also take a long time.
At this point you should have a working install with some data in it. Other things will also need to be set up (classic TODO here).
