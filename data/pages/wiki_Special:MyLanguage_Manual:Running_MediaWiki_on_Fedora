You have two options for installing MediaWiki on Fedora: installing it as an rpm/yum package or simply deploying the PHP yourself from the tarball or from the Git repository.



Running manually
This guide assumes that you are using Apache and MySQL. Feel free to add instructions for other servers and databases.
You can simply drop the tarball in a directory accessible to your web server, navigate to it and run the installation wizard. It is closer to the way the developers work, so it makes it easier for the developers to support you.
You need to have these packages installed before using MediaWiki:
httpd
mysql-server
php
php-pear
php-xml
php-mysql
php-intl
php-pecl-apc
php-gd
php-mbstring
ImageMagick-perl
So basically just doing the following command shall do

sudo yum install -y httpd mysql-server php php-pear php-xml php-mysql php-intl php-pecl-apc php-gd php-mbstring ImageMagick-perl


Installing as a package
MediaWiki is available as a part of Fedora Extras (4 or later). In order to install it, you should run

# yum install mediawiki

as root. After installation, open the file /usr/share/doc/mediawiki-x.y.z/README.RPM and follow the instructions there.
