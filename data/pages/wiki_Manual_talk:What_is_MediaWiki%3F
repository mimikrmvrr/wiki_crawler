Reply MoreHistory Edit Link to82.0.74.160‎09:16, 7 October 2012 Proposed mergerHistory SummarizeThe content on How does MediaWiki work? seems to overlap a lot with this page. Also, How does MediaWiki work? doesn't actually explain how the software work - it explains what the software is. I recognize these were originally intended for different audiences - but I think with a little effort they can serve both purposes.

In fact, it almost seems to me that the page What is MediaWiki? is more descriptive of the content of How does MediaWiki work?! Both pages are brief, which is perfectly fine. However there is overlap. How does MediaWiki work? should probably include additional content about how the software does work. The explanation of what the software is, that exists at present on the How does MediaWiki work page, could be moved nearly intact, perhaps shortened a bit, to the What is MediaWiki page, I think?
