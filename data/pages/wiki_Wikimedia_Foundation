Confused about the differences between MediaWiki, Wikimedia, Wikipedia and wiki?



Wiki
Wiki is a generic term which is used to describe a certain kind of collaborative website that can be edited by any user and/or visitor; it is not a proper noun.
wiki (as an adjective), the Wiki Way, and the antonym un-wiki are also used to describe the community-oriented philosophy that goes with such a system (e.g. "that's not a very wiki way of doing things").
Wiki (with a capital 'W') and WikiWikiWeb are used to refer to the Portland Pattern Repository, which was the first wiki to be created.
wiki software and wiki engine are terms referring to pieces of software that power wiki-based websites. There are many different types of wiki software; some very simple, others enhanced with specific advanced features. See also: Wikipedia's entry on "wiki software" or the Portland Pattern Repository's "canonical" list of wiki engines.
For a more complete description, see Wikipedia's entry on "wiki".
Wikimedia
Wikimedia is the collective name for a group of inter-related projects, including Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikisource, Wikibooks, and others, which aim to use the collaborative power of the Internet, and the wiki concept, to create and share free knowledge of all kinds. Like "Wikipedia", "Wikimedia" is a trademark, and should not be used for projects which are not officially affiliated. Wikimedia is also used as a shortened form of The Wikimedia Foundation.
The Wikimedia Foundation is the non-profit organization which funds and manages these projects. For more information, see the Foundation's homepage
The term Wikimedia servers is often used, referring to the computer hardware on which all Wikimedia projects are hosted. The servers are run by employees of the Wikimedia Foundation, many of whom also work on the MediaWiki software (see below). The Wikimedia servers are not available for hosting projects not run by the Wikimedia Foundation. See also: Wikimedia servers.
The Wikimedia Meta-Wiki, commonly referred to as Meta, is the wiki used to discuss issues which affect all Wikimedia projects. See also: Meta:About.
Meta should not be confused with MetaWiki, a search engine that is not part of the Wikimedia group of projects.

Wikimedia Deutschland, Wikimedia Russia etc. are not part of Wikimedia Foundation, but usually are friends of it.
