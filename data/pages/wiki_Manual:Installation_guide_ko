Welcome to the MediaWiki installation guide which provides instructions on how to manually install and configure MediaWiki on a web server. Note that some users may find MediaWiki software bundles and hosting services with 1-click installation and wiki farms a convenient alternative to manual installation.
The first part of this guide gives broad general instructions, while the last section contains a list of appendices that give more detailed installation notes for specific system configurations and other less common uses of the software.

빠른 설치 안내
Warning about webhost auto-installers
Programs provided by webhosts to automatically install applications such as MediaWiki can, and frequently do, screw up the process, resulting in errors and a failure to install MediaWiki (or another application for that matter). If you encounter this problem, it does not mean that you cannot install MediaWiki; all it means is that you should do it manually. This is very easy and there are benefits to doing this, including more control over where on the server and file path you want to install it, the ability to use a shared database, or the ability to control more features of the wiki during the installation.
For experienced users, here is the quick version of the installation instructions. Most users will want to read the more detailed version, below.
먼저 설치하려는 서버가 최소 사양을 넘는지 확인합니다.
미디어위키를 다운로드합니다(최신 버전 받기). 그리고 설치하려는 서버에 압축을 풉니다.
압축을 푼 곳의 config 디렉토리를 웹을 통해 접속합니다.
접속한 페이지의 설명대로 나머지 과정을 진행합니다(영어).
These instructions are deliberately brief. There is a lot that could go wrong, so if in doubt, you are advised to read the full instructions below!

Alternative to manual installation
Some users may prefer to skip manual installation by using a pre-integrated MediaWiki software appliance or hosting services with 1-click installation and wiki farms.
If you are installing only for development or testing, consider using mediawiki-vagrant. You must have (and enable) hardware virtualization. Many modern computers have this, and you can check in your BIOS.

Notes

MediaWiki ships with an installation script which allows web-based configuration
MediaWiki can share the database of another web-based application, e.g. phpBB etc.
Knowledge of PHP is required in order to customize the software
PHP 5 support has been required since MediaWiki 1.7 – if you are using an older version of PHP and cannot upgrade then you should use MediaWiki 1.6.12 (download). Note that this version is no longer supported.
MySQL 4 support has been required since MediaWiki 1.6 – if you are using an older version of MySQL and cannot upgrade then you should use MediaWiki 1.5.8 (download). Note that this version is no longer supported.
MySQL 5 support is required since MediaWiki 1.19 – if you are using an older version of MySQL and cannot upgrade, you should use MediaWiki 1.18.5 (download). Note that this version is no longer supported.
Some users find it helpful to install an additional software package such as phpMyAdmin (MySQL) or phpPgAdmin (Postgres) to help administer the database server.
